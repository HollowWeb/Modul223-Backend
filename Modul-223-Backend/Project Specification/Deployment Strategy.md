# **wYZen Deployment**

---

## **1. Overview:**
This document outlines the deployment pipeline for the wYZen application. The pipeline ensures automated builds, testing, and deployments for both frontend and backend components hosted in separate GitHub repositories.

---

## **2. Environment Setup:**
### **Environments:**
- **Development Environment:** Used for local development and initial testing.
- **Staging Environment:** Pre-production environment to validate builds and features.
- **Production Environment:** Live environment accessible to end users.

---

## **3. Pipeline Steps:**

### **Step 1: Code Commit and Version Control**
- Developers commit code to feature branches in GitHub repositories (frontend and backend).
- Feature branches are merged into the `develop` branch via pull requests after code review.
- Pull requests require automated checks (e.g., linting, unit tests) to pass before merging.
- Once features are stable, `develop` is merged into `main` for release.

### **Step 2: Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Triggered by commits/pull requests:**
    - GitHub Actions workflows start automatically.
- **Tasks Performed:**
    1. Install dependencies.
    2. Run linting and static code analysis.
    3. Execute unit and integration tests.
    4. Build the application artifacts (frontend and backend).
    5. Generate test coverage reports.

### **Step 3: Continuous Delivery (CD)**
- Upon successful CI:
    1. Artifacts are pushed to DockerHub as Docker images (tagged with version numbers).
    2. Deployment manifests (YAML files) are updated in the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) repository.
    3. Helm charts or Kubernetes configurations are applied for deployment.

### **Step 4: Deployment to Staging Environment**
- Docker images are deployed to the **staging environment** using Kubernetes or Docker Compose.
- Automated end-to-end (E2E) tests are run against staging to validate functionality.
- QA testing is performed, and sign-off is required before promoting changes.

### **Step 5: Deployment to Production Environment**
- Once staging is validated:
    1. Docker images and configurations are promoted to the **production environment**.
    2. Blue-Green Deployment strategy ensures zero downtime.
    3. Monitoring services are enabled to track system health and performance.

## **4. Tools and Services Used:**

- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker, DockerHub
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker Compose
- **Testing Frameworks:**
    - Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library, Selenium 
    - Backend: JUnit, Mockito
- **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Terraform, Helm Charts
- **Secrets Management:** HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager

---

## **5. Rollback Strategy:**
- **Automated Rollbacks:**
    - Kubernetes deployments to roll back to the last stable version in case of failure.
- **Manual Rollbacks:**
    - Revert to the previous Docker image version and reapply configurations.

---

## **6. Deployment Workflow Summary:**
1. Developer pushes code → Feature branch → Pull request to `develop`.
2. GitHub Actions run tests and build artifacts.
3. Merge into `main` → Docker images pushed to DockerHub.
4. Apply Kubernetes manifests for deployment.
5. Validate staging → Deploy to production.
6. Monitor logs, metrics, and performance.
